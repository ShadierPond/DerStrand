## Hints
- Player must watch his hunger, thirst and sleep. When one of those is empty, life is drained from its HP. HP loss increases when hungry, thirsty and/or tired.
- It is best to find a camping area and build a hut to sleep and save the game.
- Game saves ONLY when the player is sleeping. Upon dying, the player will lose their progress since the last save.

## Description
You take on the role of a shipwrecked man. Since he doesn't know the island, he must first explore it, avoid enemies or fight them. Furthermore, he has to survive on a wild island, so he has to act carefully because something could be lurking around every corner, and he has to learn to build important things to survive. This requires creativity and logic. Survival and escape from the island is the goal of the game. After finding the flare gun, fire it from the highest mountain, which will save you.
